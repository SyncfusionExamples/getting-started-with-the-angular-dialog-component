## Features and benefits

### Draggable

The Angular modal dialog can be moved anywhere in a page by dragging its header, which is performed by using the Draggable library.

### Overlays

Angular Modal dialogs create overlays on open modal windows that provide options for a user to control the closing behavior of a dialog while interacting with it.

### Additional dialogs

Users can launch multiple dialogs simultaneously or one above the other based on their z-index (z-depth) to make additional dialogs (nested modal dialogs).

### Animation

A variety of smooth, built-in animations are available to configure for the opening and closing of modal dialogs. They perform based on CSS3 animation from the Animation library.

### Resizable

The Angular modal dialog can be resized from any of the edges or borders of the dialog within the target container by using its handle (grip) or hovering on it.
